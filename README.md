# Login form and editable table

This program gives the user the opportunity to login in a web browser with a username and password. The users are saved in a database table. If the login is successful, the user can enter some extra information and when pressing the 'Submit' button, the information is saved in another table in the same database. The user can also view a table with all the information that all the users entered. The column 'Age' in this table is editable. If the user changes its value, the table is immediately updated in the database using an AJAX call.
